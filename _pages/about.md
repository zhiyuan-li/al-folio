I am a tenure-track assistant professor at [Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC)](https://www.ttic.edu/). My research focuses on machine learning and optimization, especially on deep learning theory.

I received my PhD from the [Computer Science Department](https://www.ttic.edu/) at Princeton University in 2022, where I was advised by [Prof. Sanjeev Arora](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arora/). I was a postdoctoral fellow in [Computer Science Department at Stanford University](https://www.cs.stanford.edu/), working with [Tengyu Ma](https://ai.stanford.edu/~tengyuma/). I did my undergraduate study at [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/) (2013-2017), Tsinghua University.
